# xlOil

xlOil is a framework for building Excel language bindings. That is, a way to write functions in a language of your choice and have them appear in Excel.

xlOil is designed to have very low overheads when calling your own worksheet functions.

xlOil supports different languages via plugins. The languages currently supported are:

- C++
- Python
- SQL

You can use xlOil as an end-user of these plugins or you can use it to write you own language bindings and contribute.
